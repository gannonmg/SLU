5) Testing each number is logically independent because it is run through is_prime() individually and its return value does not impact the other numbers computations at all.

6) Testing 7 and 9 in this case is not independent of testing the number 5 because if it turns out that N is divisible by 5, you do not need to continue testing it for numbers larger than 7 and 9.

7) Both programs output the correct primes, but the parallelized version does not print them in sequential order.

8) For 1 mil, the sequential program took on average 0.366s on hopper. On average, the parallelized program took 0.034s.

For 20 mil, the sequential program took 24.648s on hopper. On average, the parallelized program took 1.537s.
